# Form Handling and Validation in React: `useForm` Hook

## Introduction

Recently, I was working on a project and I ran into a problem with a **form** with **multiple input fields** that were giving the same error message even when the user left the different required fields blank.  
To fix this problem, I started exploring and researching different options. That's when I discovered the **useForm hook in React**, a powerful tool for **handling form logic** and **validation**. With the useForm hook, I was able to fix the problem and make it clear to the users why the error was happening. This is my story of how I discovered the useForm hook and how it improved my development and **user experience**.

## Understanding Form Validation and Logic

To make things easier and understand it practically let us take an example:

Imagine you're building a **sign-up form** for a website, one of the crucial pages on the website, where **users can enter their personal information** to create an account. Without the useForm hook, handling form logic and validation on the signup page would be a **difficult task**.

In a standard sign-up form, **What do you need?**

* Email
    
* Password
    
* Confirm Password

Now, that you have identified what all `input` fields are required. Let's analyse what should be the conditions for these inputs from the user.

* The **email** should be a **valid** email (`example@gmail.com`)
    
* **Password** must be at least **8 characters** long
    
* '**Confirm Password**' must **match the password**
    

### Objective

1. To give `errors` when `input` fields are empty

2. To show `error` when the above conditions are not fulfilled

To handle this `(without useForm)` :

Firstly, you would have to write your own validation logic to check that all the required fields are filled out and that the information is entered in the correct format. For example, if the user is supposed to enter an email address, you would have to write the code to check that it's a valid email address. This would require a lot of repetitive code and would be **prone to errors**.

Secondly, you would have to **handle form submissions manually**. This would mean writing code to **handle the user's input** and **send it to the server for processing**. This would also require a lot of repetitive code and would be **time-consuming**.

But with the `useForm` hook, **handling form logic and validation** is a **breeze**.  
Here's how:

The hook provides several methods, the ones we will be using are `register`, `handleSubmit`, `getValues` and `formstate`

### **register**

The `register` method allows you to **register an input field** with the hook and define its validation rules and other properties.

Looks like the below.

```typescript
const { register} = useForm();

<form>
    <input {...register(name, options)} />
</form>
```

\-&gt; the `name` parameter is used to **specify the name** of the input field, which allows easier access to the value of that field in the `formState` object.

```typescript
register("email")
```

`output -> {email: valueOfTheReferencedInput}`

\-&gt; the `options` passed will be used to **define** the **validation rules** for the input.

```typescript
register("email", {
    required: true,
    onChange: () => console.log("this is email address")
})
```

### handleSubmit

When the form is submitted, the `handleSubmit` method will **first validate** all the input fields. If any **validation errors occur**, the form **submission will be prevented** and the **errors will be displayed** to the user.  
If there are **no validation errors**, the `handleSubmit` method will **call the callback** function passed to it as a parameter. This function can be used to handle the form data and send it to the server for processing.

```typescript
const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(() => console.log("form is successfully validated and sent to server for processing"))}>
  ...
</form>
```

### getValues

The `getValues` method is used to **retrieve the current values** of all the input fields, so that there is no need to useState them.

```typescript
const { register, getValues } = useForm();

<form> 
    <input value="example email"{...register("email")} />
</form>

const emailInput = getValues("email")
console.log("emailInput") // output -> "example email"
```

### formState

The `formState` object is used to access the current state of the form, including the values of the **input fields**, the **errors**, and other properties like `isSubmitting`, `isValid`, `touched`, `errors` and many more. For this example, we are interested in `errors` only.

```typescript
const {register, formState: {errors}} = useForm()

<form>
  <p>
    {errors.email?.message}
  </p>
  <input {...register("email")}/>
</form>
```

## Let's Apply this

First, we need to register our inputs with the `register` method, so go ahead and do that:

**Note:** that we don't need to have `name` attribute in our inputs since it is handled by `register` method.

```typescript
import {useForm} from "react-hook-form"

function App() {
 const {register} = useForm();

 return (
    <form>

      {/* email */}
      <input {...register("email")} type="email" id="email" />

      {/* password */}
      <input {...register("password")} type="password" id="password" />

      {/* confirm password */}
      <input {...register("confirmPassword")} type="password" id="confirmPassword" />   
        </form>
    )
}
```

Now we need to give each one of them the **validation conditions**.

* **For Email:** It is required and It must be a valid email, so we can use `required` and `pattern`.
    

```typescript
 <input {...register("email"), {
        required: "Please Enter Your Email!",
        pattern: {
            value: /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i, 
            message: "Please Enter A Valid Email!"
        }
    }} type="email" id="email" />
```

If the user did not type his email, the `errors` object from the `formState` will contain the message we typed with the `required` property, And if the email is not valid `errors` will contain the message from `pattern`.

Now we can show the error message.

```typescript
<input ... />
<p className="error-message">{errors.email?.message}</p>
```

* **For Password:** It is required and it must be longer than 8 characters
    

```typescript
<input {...register("password"), {
        required: "Please Enter Your Password",
        minLength: {
        value: 8,
        message: "Password must be at least 8 characters long!"
        }
    }} type="password" id="password" />
```

To show `error` message.

```typescript
<input ... />
<p className="error-message">{errors.password?.message}</p>
```

* **For Confirm Password:** This one is special because it only needs to match the password for validation to meet the condition, so we can use `validate` option's method, we also need `getValue` to get the password value.
    

```typescript
<input {...register("confirmPassword", {
        validate: (match) => {
            const password = getValues("password")
            return match === password || "Passwords should match!"
        }
    })} type="password" id="confirmPassword" />
```

To show `error` message.

```typescript
<input ... />
<p className="error-message">{errors.confirmPassword?.message}</p>
```

Now we're finished with the validation! It's time to use `handleSubmit`.

```typescript
<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(() => console.log("user registered successfully!"))}>
    ...
</form>
```

VoilaðŸ¥³, we did that so easily and quickly!

To refer to the whole code -

```typescript
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

function UseformApp() {
  const {
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    getValues,
    formState: { errors },
  } = useForm();
  return (
    <div className="container">
      <form
        onSubmit={handleSubmit(() =>
          console.log("user registered successfully!")
        )}
      >
        <h1>Sign Up Form</h1>
        {/* email */}
        <div className="inputContainer">
          <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
          <input
            {...register("email", {
              required: "Please Enter Your Email!",
              pattern: {
                value: /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}$/i,
                message: "Please Enter A Valid Email!",
              },
            })}
            type="email"
            id="email"
            className={`${errors.email && "input-error"}`}
          />
          <p className="errorMes">{errors.email?.message}</p>
        </div>

        {/* password */}
        <div className="inputContainer">
          <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
          <input
            {...register("password", {
              required: "Please Enter Your Password",
              minLength: {
                value: 8,
                message: "Password must be at least 8 characters long!",
              },
            })}
            type="password"
            id="password"
            className={`${errors.password && "input-error"}`}
          />
          <p className="errorMes">{errors.password?.message}</p>
        </div>

        {/* confirm password */}
        <div className="inputContainer">
          <label htmlFor="confirmPassword">Confirm Password</label>
          <input
            {...register("confirmPassword", {
              required: "Please Confirm Your Password",
              validate: (match) => {
                const password = getValues("password");
                return match === password || "Passwords should match!";
              },
            })}
            type="password"
            id="confirmPassword"
            className={`${errors.confirmPassword && "input-error"}`}
          />
          <p className="errorMes">{errors.confirmPassword?.message}</p>
        </div>

        {/* button */}
        <button>SIGN UP</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}

export default UseformApp;
```
