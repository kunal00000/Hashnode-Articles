### Challenges encountered during the writing process...

As a writer, I work super hard to make my stuff fun and easy to read. But man, it's tough to get people's attention these days with everyone hooked on short-form content like YouTube shorts, Reels, and TikTok. Like, who's got time for long reads anymore? Nah, not me either, I totally get it, with all the quick content out there, it's no wonder our attention spans are getting shorter.

Additionally, Writing itself can be a struggle. Coming up with ideas, organizing my thoughts, and being satisfied with the final result is always a challenge.

Yeah, I feel you. So, to get more peeps to check out our blog and make it worth their time, we got to be super creative, awesome, and give them something they'll actually want to read.

Recently, I came across two amazing tools, Hashnode Ai and Rix which helps me write more effectively and share my knowledge and insights in such a clear, concise, and fantastic way! I'm beyond thrilled with the results! Let's see how...

### Generate Outline for Article.

One of the first things Hashnode AI helps me with is organizing my thoughts. Before using it, I would often start writing without a clear plan, and my ideas would end up all over the place.

I've realized that before starting to write, having a good outline is crucial. Hashnode AI and **Rix** understand this and effortlessly create an outline for me. With just a few clicks, I can organize my thoughts, set up my post, and ensure a smooth flow from beginning to end. It feels like having a game plan for my next awesome post.

It keeps me on track and ensured that my writing is well-structured.

### With Ai as Your Research Buddy

One of the remarkable things I discovered is that AI chatbot is incredibly useful for researching any topic. It has become my go-to resource when I want to enhance my knowledge and create more insightful posts.

It provides me with valuable suggestions and recommendations to improve the quality and clarity of my writing. I can rely on AI to help me craft compelling sentences and articulate my ideas more effectively. It is like having a personal writing coach or companion by my side, guiding me every step of the way.

### Attract readers by providing a concise summary.

With just a simple command, I can generate a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary of my article. This concise snippet gives readers a quick overview of what to expect, curating them to dive deeper into the content. It is a game-changer in captivating my audience right from the start.

### Get Your Blog to Rank Higher on Google

SEO is super important for all of us content creators. The AI's got my back, helping me step up my SEO game.

Coming up with **Catchy** and **SEO-friendly** titles and content can be a pain, right? But the Hashnode AI Chatbot whips up a bunch of awesome SEO titles for my articles in no time. I just pick the one that fits best and boom â€“ I'm ready to pull in more organic traffic.

### Rewrite Content

Another area where Hashnode AI made a huge difference is in improving the clarity of my writing. I often use jargon and technical terms that some readers wouldn't understand. But Hashnode AI helped me rewrite my content in a way that was clear and easy to grasp.

### Revise the writing tone.

Hashnode AI also helped me with the tone of my writing. I used to write in a formal and academic style, which made my writing sound stiff and boring. But with the help of Hashnode AI, I am learning how to adjust my tone to match my audience. This can make my writing more engaging and accessible.

In a simple example, let's explore how this works:

Text: "**Showcasing your learnings and insights in the form of blogs is incredible.**"

**Shorten**: Blogging your learnings and insights is fantastic.

**Friendly**: Sharing your knowledge and discoveries through blog posts is such a wonderful idea!

**Casual**: Sharing what you've learned and your cool thoughts through blog posts is pretty awesome.

**Professional**: Demonstrating your acquired knowledge and understanding through the medium of blog posts is highly commendable.

**Excited**: Oh my goodness, showcasing your learnings and insights through blogs is absolutely phenomenal!

**Confident**: Sharing what you've learned through blog posts is fantastic.

**Appreciative**: It's truly remarkable how you're able to share your learnings and insights through engaging blog posts. Keep up the fantastic work.

### Eliminate Grammatical and Spelling Errors

I used to feel a bit unsure about my writing because of grammatical and spelling mistakes, I used to use Grammarly, but now I can easily fix those little mistakes and make my writing look so much more polished and professional.

### Effortless Code Snippets

As a tech blogger, it's pretty common for me to include code snippets in my posts. However, this used to come with its own set of challenges, like formatting issues and readability concerns. But guess what? With the Code Blocks feature, all those worries just disappeared.

Text: "Write a program to print hello world in Golang"ðŸ˜Ž

```go
// Go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

(PS: I don't know Golang but I can use it in my blogs. ðŸ˜…)
